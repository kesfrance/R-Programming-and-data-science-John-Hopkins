# R-Programming-and-data-science-John-Hopkins

This is a Repository of R programs generated from the data science course series on cousera.

So far I have taken the course in R-programming and exploratory data analysis, so this 
repo will contain the scripts generated from those two courses.

The course URL for R-programming is https://class.coursera.org/rprog-010
that for exploratory data analysis is https://class.coursera.org/exdata-011

This repo will be updated every now and then, as i have a number of scripts more to add.

I would want to document them properly before i put them up but i ma very bussy at the moment 

I will also add more scripts when I complete more courses in the series.

The data files contain the data set on which the scripts were evaluated.

The scripts pollutantmean.R, complete.R, corr.R were developed to analyse the pollution monitoring
data for particulate matter air pollution at 332 locations in the united States. I will soon upload the data
