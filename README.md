# R-Programming-and-data-science-John-Hopkins

This is a Repository of R programs generated from the data science course series on cousera

so far I have taken the course in R-programming and exploratory data analysis, so this 
repo will contain the scripts generated from those two courses.

The course URL for R-programming is https://class.coursera.org/rprog-010
that for exploratory data analysis is https://class.coursera.org/exdata-011

I will add more scripts when I complete more courses in the series.

The data files contain the data set on which the scripts were evaluated.
