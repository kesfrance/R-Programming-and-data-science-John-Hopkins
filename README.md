# R-Programming-and-data-science-John-Hopkins

This is a Repository for R programs generated from the data science course series on cousera.

The course URL for R-programming is https://class.coursera.org/rprog-010

This repo will be updated every now and then, as i have a number of scripts more to add.

The data files contain the data set on which the scripts were evaluated.

The scripts pollutantmean.R, complete.R, corr.R were developed to analyse the pollution monitoring
data for particulate matter air pollution at 332 locations in the United States. I will soon upload the data set.
